# Dynamic-Calculator
This project is a simple light/dark mode calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It offers basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

The calculator interface consists of a display area at the top where the user input and the calculated result are shown. Below the display, there are buttons for numbers (0-9), decimal point, clear, and arithmetic operators (/ * - +). The equal (=) button computes the result based on the expression entered by the user.

One notable feature of this calculator is its ability to switch between light and dark modes. By clicking on the circular toggle button located at the top right corner of the page, the user can switch between the two themes, providing a customized visual experience.

The light mode features a clean and minimalist design with a white background, while the dark mode offers a sleek and modern appearance with a dark background. The color scheme and styling of the calculator adapt accordingly to provide optimal visibility and usability in both modes.

Overall, this project serves as a practical demonstration of building a responsive and visually appealing calculator application with support for light and dark modes, catering to different user preferences and environments.
